To check the `index.html` file, you can open it directly in a web browser.

1.  Open your file explorer and navigate to the root of your project directory.
2.  Double-click `index.html` or drag it into your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

You should see an HTML playground with a textarea for input and several output areas for the DOM representation, HTML serialization, text content, and any parsing errors.

Try pasting different HTML snippets into the input textarea and observe the outputs. This will allow you to interactively test the `justjshtml` library.
